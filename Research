I watched this video to understand a very basic level of pygame, it invovles creating a square that can move around with the keyboard. This video taught me how I can open a window and how to move things around with a keyboard using the WASD keys.

I watched some parts of this video on 2x speed because its really long, I only watched the parts that applys to the type of game I want to make like enemy spawn logic, sprites, animations, and music.
