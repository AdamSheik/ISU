# ISU
my ISU project
After changing my idea and brainstorming a new idea my project is going to be a mini dungeon game
TITLE: Adam's Dungeon
The purpose of this project is to make a dungeon game that is fun and try to make it more unique compared to all the other pygame dungeon games
I will be using pygame to make my game
