MY ISU IDEA
After changing my idea and brainstorming a new idea my project is going to involve controlling a character and dodging obstacles to reach the goal
TITLE: Adams Platforms
The purpose of this project is to make a game im satisfied with and to make myself become comfortable with pygame so I can create more games in the future. Also I will try to not make it too simple where its not hard at all but at the same time not too complex to where I dont understand my code.
I will be using pygame to make my game
